# SimpleValidator
Created with CodeSandbox

After getting a little tired of overly complex validation libraries I wanted one that did exactly what I needed. You simply
pass an object of conditions and an optional message for each one so you know exactly what's going to be hit.

See the 'options' file for more infomation.

A quick implementation can be found on the index.js and index.html file.
